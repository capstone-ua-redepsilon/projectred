#What Is It?
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a *synchronous*, *cooperative*, *puzzle* game developed for Android.

#Wat?
The puzzles designed for CTF require realtime coordination between 2-4 (depending on the puzzle) players in order to be solved completely.

#How Does It Work?
Once a team has been gathered and a puzzle started, each player will be able to select one character to act as. Each character has a unique ability which can work in combination with other abilities to solve the puzzle.

#What Kind of Puzzles?
The puzzles are platform-based levels with a starting point and several "flags" distributed to distinct locations throughout. In order to complete the puzzles successfully, the players will need to collect each of the flags using their characters' skills.

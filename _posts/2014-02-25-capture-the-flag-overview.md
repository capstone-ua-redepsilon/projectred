`Capture the Flag` is a synchronous, multiplayer puzzle game developed for mobile platforms and inspired by cooperative games such as Portal. The puzzles included will require a specific number of players to play and interact in real time. Each player will be able to select one character from an assortment of characters, each which has a particular property or skill that the player can use. Each puzzle will be able to be solved with a particular combination of characters. The puzzles will typically be platform-based levels with a starting point and several "flags" distributed to distinct locations throughout the level. In order to complete the levels successfully, the players will need to collect each of the flags using their characters' unique skills.

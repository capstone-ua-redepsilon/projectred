Merlot
======

Merlot is a fancy theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), adapted from the [GitHub Pages theme](https://github.com/cameronmcefee/merlot) of the same name. I used the [Solar theme](https://github.com/redwallhp/solar-theme-jekyll.git) as a guide to convert the GitHub Pages theme into a more general Jekyll one (in that I essentially just merged the two projects!).

Try it out [here](http://ZedThree.github.io/merlot-theme-jekyll)!

Installation
--------------

There are two ways to use Solar. You can either clone-and-go, copying the repository and tweaking the contents to taste, or you can cherry-pick the files you want and integrate them into an existing Jekyll instance.

If you're starting a new blog, you want to clone-and-go. Just `git clone https://github.com/ZedThree/merlot-theme-jekyll.git`, make any changes you want to the template, pages or `_config.yml` and start blogging with Jekyll. Easy.

If you're wanting to replace the theme of an existing Jekyll blog, either option should work. If you want to replace files individually, the files and directories you want to make sure to copy are:

1. `_layouts`
2. `assets`
3. `index.html`

You'll also want to compare Merlot's `_config.yml` with your own, making any appropriate changes.
